# DoEvent

-Team project with 5 members( We all worked on both: the front end and the backend tasks)

-The purpose of our application is to give the possibility to the users to create their own bucket list with the top things to do at university in order to live the student life experience to the fullest.
-We had to build a web application that will let users keep track of everything that should be checked in these years.
-The application  allow users to check off items that have been accomplished, see what is in trending, search for new bucket list ideas, see othersâ€™ lists, add to your to-do list, share it and post pictures, videos, notes or comments; but in order for all these the user should be logged into the application.
-The application has a modern layout, easy to follow, respect the accessibility demands and it can be accessed from laptop, desktop and mobile devices.
-When an activity is commented or rated, the user will receive a notification.
-The users cand filter their own items, for example: restaurants to eat, places to visit, concerts to go and much more.
